# Dart Unhandled JSON Key Access

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart applications when working with JSON responses: accessing a key that might not exist.  This often leads to runtime exceptions and crashes.

The `bug.dart` file contains the flawed code, and `bugSolution.dart` provides a corrected version.  The problem arises from directly accessing `jsonData['key']` without checking if the 'key' exists.

This is a critical issue in production environments as it can lead to unexpected application behavior.  Proper error handling and input validation are essential to prevent such scenarios.
